# Docker Enterprise Edition Exercises

No matter where you are in your Docker journey, these exercises are meant to help demystify some Docker concepts and guide users along specific learning path depending on their use case and expertise level.

These workshops are only available to people in a pre-arranged workshop. That may happen through a [Docker Meetup](https://events.docker.com/chapters/), a conference workshop that is being led by someone who has made these arrangements, or special arrangements between Docker and your company. The workshop leader will provide you with the URL to a workshop environment that includes [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition). The environment will be based on [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).
